In this project, the football player transfer value has been predicted using machine learning. The purpose of this project is to help clubs identify the right transfer value of the player. The dataset chosen is the FIFA 21 dataset which contains information on 17,000 + players. However, the purpose of the project was to identify the transfer category of the player and not just the value. Hence, the market value which was a continuous varlable has been converted into a categorical variable where they have been divided into 3 classes - 0,1 and 2 based on their market value 
The KDD methodology was applied here. The first step carried out was the Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data. The dataset contained a lot of null values. Some of the values in the dataset were in symbolic font and unreadable. Some of the variables were categorical and had to be converted. The dataset was very imbalanced with the middle class of players having the highest number of players. 
The null values were removed. One hot encoding was applied as well. The imbalanced dataset was converted into a balanced dataset using scaling. Values with high correlation were removed to avoid the problem of redundancy. Finally, the algorithms were applied based on the problem statement, objective, speed and accuracy.
The Support Vector Classifier turned out to be the best performing algorithm after parameter tuning with an accuracy of 85.7%.
